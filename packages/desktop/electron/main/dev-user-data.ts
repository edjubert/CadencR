 * The order is the whole point. `CADENCR_DEV_USER_DATA_SUFFIX` is what keeps
 * each worktree on its own profile, `scripts/configure-worktree-dev.mts` writes
 * it into `packages/desktop/.env`, and nothing else puts it in the environment
 * — so reading the suffix before loading that file silently yields the shared
 * `desktop-dev` profile for every checkout. Since Electron's single-instance
 * lock is keyed on `userData`, the second worktree to start then dies with
 * "second instance — exiting" even though its ports are unique.
 *
 * A `.env` failure is returned, not thrown: this runs at module scope, before
 * `app.whenReady()` and so outside the startup-recovery `catch` — raising here
 * would take the app down with nothing on screen. `bootstrap()` re-raises it
 * where it can at least be reported.
