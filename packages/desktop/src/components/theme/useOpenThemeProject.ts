/**
 * Open a theme for editing — which means going to its project.
 *
 * A theme isn't edited in a dialog: it has a project of its own, so the file
 * sits in the editor, an agent works beside it and git records what changed,
 * exactly as for any other code. Creation returns the ready workspace; later
 * opens resolve those same ids through the idempotent workspace endpoint.
 *
 * Opening also *wears* the theme. The whole reason a theme has a project rather
 * than a modal is that the user keeps using the app while it is being restyled,
 * and that only means anything if the app is wearing the theme being edited —
 * every save, whether the user's or the agent's, then repaints the window they
 * are already looking at.
