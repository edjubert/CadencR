/**
 * Renders an inline diff eagerly, letting the browser skip layout, style and
 * paint while it is off-screen (`deferred-paint`).
 *
 * This used to be gated behind an `IntersectionObserver` that decided whether to
 * *mount* the diff at all. That was a second virtualization layer stacked on the
 * stream's own, and the two disagreed: the observer measured against the browser
 * viewport while Virtuoso mounts rows well outside it, so a diff the user was
 * looking at could still be showing the "deferred" placeholder. Worse, resolving
 * a short placeholder into a 500px diff changed the row's height *after* it had
 * been measured — the conversation jumping while scrolling up.
 *
 * The trade is deliberate, not free: Pierre now instantiates for every expanded
 * diff in Virtuoso's mount window, which is wider than the old 600px observer
 * margin, and `content-visibility` skips rendering work but not React rendering
 * or patch parsing. What it buys is a height that no longer changes after
 * measurement, which is the actual bug.
