 *

 * is what stops the value from being *retained* in the Zustand store for the
 * session and re-handed to the markdown parser on every mount.
 *
 * Clamped blocks set `truncatedContent`. Note that only Bash tool_results
 * currently render the "load full output" affordance
 * (`GET /api/sessions/messages/{id}/full`); for every other shape the inline
 * `TRUNCATION_NOTICE` is the user-visible signal.
